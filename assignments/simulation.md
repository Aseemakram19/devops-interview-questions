Simulate the following situation. Attach the code as part of your submission.

* At a post office, customers enter a single line waiting to be served by any one of two clerks. 
* Every minute there is a 60% chance that a new customer arrives. 
* If there is no one in line and a server is free, the customer does not wait to be served. 
* When a customer is being served there is a 25% chance every minute that they complete their business and leave. 
* When the clerk is free he will take the next customer in line, in the order that they arrived. 
* Every minute, there is a 5% chance that a person standing in line will give up and leave. 
* The post office is always open (24/7/365).
* Note: For simplicity you can assume customers will always arrive at the beginning of the minute and if they leave they do so at the end of the minute.

* What is the average amount of time a customer spends in the post office (including those not served)?
* What percentage of customers leave without being served?
* What percentage of time are the clerks idle?
